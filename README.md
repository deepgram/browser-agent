# Browser Agent

This is our state-of-the-art for integrating with Deepgram's Voice Agent API in a browser
environment.

## Prerequisites

- [Node v18 or 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (though I recommend installing it through
  [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating))

## Running locally

Use `npm run vite` to start a dev server. You'll need to set a `DG_API_KEY` environment variable in
order to open a connection.
